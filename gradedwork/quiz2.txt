Question:
   What is the value printed by the program shown above?
   Grading function: answer=="202"
   Your answer was: 202
You have chosen wisely! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: The loop executes 101 times, each time bumping k by 2, so it reaches the value 202 when the loop is done.

Question:
   What is the value of i at the end of the program shown above?
   Grading function: answer=="101"
   Your answer was: 101
Glad you got that one! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: The complement of the loop's predicate is i>100.  With i increasing by 1 each interation, it must reach the value of 101 when the loop exits.

Question:
   The code for A should be
   Grading function: answer=="i = 0"
   Your answer was: i = 0
Glad you got that one! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: The loop initiliazation appears at "A".

Question:
   The code for B should be
   Grading function: answer=="i <= 100"
   Your answer was: i <= 100
Nice job! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: The loop condition for continuing (terating)  appears at "B".

Question:
   The code for C should be
   Grading function: answer=="i = i + 1"
   Your answer was: i = i + 1
Way to go! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: The action to be taken at the end of the loop body appears at "C".

Question:
   The code for D should be
   Grading function: answer=="k = k + 2"
   Your answer was: k = k + 2
You have chosen wisely! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: The for loop is operating only on i, so the bump of should occur inside, at"D".

Question:
   The code for E should be
   Grading function: answer.include?("println")
   Your answer was: System.out.println(k)
You have chosen wisely! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: The output was produced after the loop, so it it should appear at"E".

Question:
   Which variable should go in the box A?
   Grading function: answer.include?("allergies")
   Your answer was: allergies
Way to go! You have earned 7 points.

Explanation: Based on the logic of this program, we should test for allergies at "A"

Question:
   Which variable should go in the box B?
   Grading function: answer.include?("voteForMM")
   Your answer was: voteForMMs
You have chosen wisely! You have earned 8 points.

Explanation: Based on the logic of this program, we should test for the outcome of the random trial here at "B"

Question:
   After running this code, what is the value of array[5]?
   Grading function: answer=="12"
   Your answer was: 12
You have chosen wisely! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: array[5] does not change in this code, so it is 12 as originally assigned.

Question:
   After running this code, what is the value of array[4]?
   Grading function: answer=="20"
   Your answer was: 20
You have chosen wisely! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: array[4] is set to the sum of array[3] and array[5], which are 8 and 12, respectively;   thus array[4] is 20 after the code executes.

Question:
   After running this code, what is the value of array[3]?
   Grading function: answer=="12"
   Your answer was: 12
You have chosen wisely! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: array[3] is set to the value of array[5], which is 12 as origiinally assigned.

Question:
   What belongs in section A?
   Grading function: answer=="N"
   Your answer was: N
Glad you got that one! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: As the problem states, the array should have N values so we need N inside the brackets at "A" to instantiate an array of the appropriate size.

Question:
   What belongs in section B?
   Grading function: answer=="N"
   Your answer was: N
Way to go! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: Because i starts at 0 and we are computing N values, the correct predicate is i<N at "B".

Question:
   What belongs in section C?
   Grading function: answer=="i"
   Your answer was: i
You have chosen wisely! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: To create a value at each index location of the array, the store must be to array[i] at "C".

Question:
   What belongs in section D?
   Grading function: answer=="3*(i+1)"
   Your answer was: 3*(i+1)
Glad you got that one! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: To achieve the sequence 3, 6, 9, ..., with i starting at 0, we must use the expression 3i+1 at "D".

Question:
   What belongs in section A?
   Grading function: answer=="N-1"
   Your answer was: N-1
Glad you got that one! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: The predicate uses <= so we must stop when i is greater than N-1.  Thus N=1 goes at section "A".

Question:
   What belongs in section B?
   Grading function: answer.include?("above")
   Your answer was: Any of the above
Nice job! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: All of the choices increase i by 1, which is what is needed at section "B".

Question:
   What belongs in section C?
   Grading function: answer=="N - 1 - i"
   Your answer was: N - 1 - i
Way to go! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: The indexes here must go backwards, starting at the last valid index of the array, which is at N-1.  When i is 0, N-1-i is N-1, the last element;  when i is N-1, N-1-(N-1) is 0, the first element.  Thus N-1-i is the only valid choice for "C".


Your total score is 100.
